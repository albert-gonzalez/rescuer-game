#Rescuer
http://albert-gonzalez.github.io/rescuer-game/

**Rescue all the lemmings that you can!** Click on them for open their umbrellas. The more lemmings you rescue, the game will be harder!

**Rescuer** is a simple game I created for fun. The game uses **CreateJS** as game Engine and **RequireJS** as module loader. Also, I used other useful libraries like **jQuery**, **share button**, **underscore** and **easytimer**.

I chose lemmings because is a game that i loved when I was a child.

Enjoy It!
